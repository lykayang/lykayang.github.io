Transform the input image into **Studio Ghibli–inspired artwork** while preserving all original spatial relationships.

★ 1 — Artistic Style
• Hand-drawn linework: soft, slightly uneven strokes that feel organic  
• Palette: warm, vivid hues with gentle gradients (sunlit yellows, dusty terracottas, muted teals)  
• Textures: watercolor washes in the background, light gouache layering in the foreground, subtle paper grain  
• Shading & lighting: mild cel-style shading for volume, cozy golden back-light or rim-light to enhance warmth  
• Atmosphere: whimsical, slightly dreamy, evoking quiet wonder and a sense of storytelling

★ 2 — Subject Fidelity
• **STRICTLY PRESERVE FACIAL FEATURES**: eyes, nose, mouth, and overall facial proportions must remain accurate and recognizable  
• Retain the subject’s exact **expression, pose, clothing, and props**  
• Keep hairstyle, accessories, and surface details unchanged—only restyle their rendering

★ 3 — Composition Integrity
• **DO NOT** crop, rotate, mirror, resize, or reposition any element  
• Keep the original camera perspective, framing, and aspect ratio exactly as in the source

★ 4 — Output & Technical Specs
• Resolution: ≥ 4 K (or original, whichever is higher)  
• Aspect ratio: identical to input  
• File format: PNG or JPEG, artifact-free  
• Color profile: sRGB  
• Background must remain contextually consistent; add only subtle Ghibli-style environmental details (e.g., drifting dust, distant birds) without altering layout

★ 5 — Negative Constraints
• No stylization drift into chibi, manga, or Western cartoon aesthetics  
• No facial distortion, exaggeration, or de-aging  
• Avoid heavy outlines, posterization, neon highlights, or glitch effects  
• Do not introduce additional objects, characters, or text overlays

**Goal:** The final image should look like a frame from a classic Ghibli film—soft, warm, and narrative-rich—while remaining unmistakably faithful to the original subject and composition.
