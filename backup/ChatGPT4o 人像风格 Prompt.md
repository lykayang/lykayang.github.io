Pixar Style

	•	Expression: Retain the original facial expression and emotional tone, adapting it naturally to the animated style.

	•	Lighting & Texture: Apply Pixar-style lighting with soft, natural highlights and shadows, adding a sense of depth and realism to the character. Use smooth, stylized textures for skin, hair, and clothing, with a slightly exaggerated yet believable 3D finish.

Optional enhancements:
